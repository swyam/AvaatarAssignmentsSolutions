## Overview
This notebook allows for the execution of Stable Diffusion on Google Colab, facilitating the generation of images from text descriptions.

## Setup
To get started:
1. Upload the notebook to your Google Colab environment.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Sequentially run each cell to set up the environment and execute the model.
3. Input text descriptions as prompted to generate images using Stable Diffusion.

### Notebook Structure
- **Markdown Cells**: Contain explanations and instructions.
- **Code Cells**: Contain Python code to configure the environment and run the model.

## ControlNet Module
The notebook includes integration with the ControlNet module, which allows for enhanced control over the image generation process. ControlNet provides a mechanism to influence the structure and features of the generated images based on additional input conditions.

## Additional Resources
For further enhancements and functionalities, you can explore:
- [Asymmetric Tiling SD WebUI](https://github.com/tjm35/asymmetric-tiling-sd-webui/tree/main): A web interface for asymmetric tiling in Stable Diffusion.
